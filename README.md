## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi, I’m Gautam — the kind of developer who likes to dig into how things work, break them (sometimes on purpose), and build them back better.
I spend a lot of time messing around with code — whether it’s writing quick Python scripts that solve a random problem I made up, poking at game mechanics in Unity just to see what breaks, or experimenting with weird NLP models to make chatbots say funny things.
You’ll usually find me flipping between VS Code tabs, Stack Overflow threads, and 20+ Chrome tabs I swear I’ll read. I enjoy that chaotic learning phase where nothing makes sense… until suddenly it does.
I’m currently trying to get more into open source, contribute to projects I admire, and maybe share a few of my own ideas along the way.

## 🧰 Stuff I Usually Work With

Here's the tech I'm most comfortable with — the stuff I actually use when building, tinkering, or learning something new:

- 🐍 **Python**: My go-to for quick scripts, APIs, and all things ML/NLP  
- 🎮 **Unity + C#**: I love building gameplay systems, experiments, and little game ideas that sometimes turn into full projects  
- ⚛️ **ReactJS**: Helps me bring chaotic frontend ideas to life (with minimal screaming)  
- 🚀 **FastAPI / Node.js**: For backend APIs — FastAPI especially makes life easier  
- 🧠 **ML/NLP**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, SpaCy, NLTK, and a sprinkle of LLM chaos  
- 🧩 **Databases & APIs**: MySQL, NoSQL (usually Firebase), RESTful stuff  
- 🛠️ **Tools**: Git, VS Code, and a bunch of browser tabs

## 🎯 Just for Fun: "Which Tech Am I?"

> 🧪 I clean your data, help you analyze it, and I'm friends with Jupyter. What am I?  
> 💡 I'm fast, async, and I love Python APIs. What am I?  
> 🕹️ I power 2D and 3D games, and you script me with C#. What am I?
